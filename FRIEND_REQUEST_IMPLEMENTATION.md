# Friend Request Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive friend request system for your social feed application. The feature works similar to Facebook's friend system, where users send requests that must be accepted before becoming friends.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`FRIEND_REQUESTS_MIGRATION.sql`)
- **IMPORTANT**: You must run this SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor before the feature will work
- Location: `/FRIEND_REQUESTS_MIGRATION.sql`
- Creates the `friend_requests` table with proper RLS policies
- Includes indexes for optimal performance
- Prevents self-friending and duplicate requests

### 2. Backend Functions (`src/lib/social.ts`)
Added the following helper functions:
- `sendFriendRequest()` - Send a friend request to another user
- `acceptFriendRequest()` - Accept an incoming friend request
- `rejectFriendRequest()` - Reject an incoming friend request
- `cancelFriendRequest()` - Cancel a sent friend request
- `removeFriend()` - Unfriend someone
- `getFriendshipStatus()` - Check relationship status between users
- `getPendingFriendRequests()` - Get all incoming pending requests
- `getSentFriendRequests()` - Get all outgoing pending requests
- `getFriends()` - Get list of friends for a user
- `getFriendCount()` - Get friend count for a user

### 3. AddFriendButton Component (`src/components/SocialFeed/AddFriendButton.tsx`)
A smart button that dynamically changes based on friendship status:
- **"Add Friend"** (blue) - Send a friend request
- **"Request Sent"** (gray) - Request pending, click to cancel
- **"Accept/Reject"** (green/red) - Accept or reject incoming request
- **"Friends"** (gray) - Already friends, click to unfriend

Features:
- Compact mode for use in post cards
- Dropdown menus for additional actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Optimistic UI updates

### 4. FriendRequestsNotification Component (`src/components/SocialFeed/FriendRequestsNotification.tsx`)
Notification badge in the feed header:
- Shows count of pending friend requests
- Red badge indicator with count
- Dropdown panel showing all pending requests
- Accept/Reject buttons for each request
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Shows user profile pictures and names

### 5. Integration
- Added AddFriendButton to every post card (PostCard.tsx)
- Button appears next to username for posts from other users
- Added FriendRequestsNotification to FeedPage header
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Sending a Request**: Click "Add Friend" on any user's post
2. **Button Updates**: Changes to "Request Sent" with option to cancel
3. **Receiving a Request**: Notification badge appears in header
4. **Accepting**: Click notification bell, then "Accept" button
5. **Both users become friends**: Button shows "Friends" on both sides
6. **Unfriending**: Click "Friends" button and select "Remove Friend"

### Button States by Friendship Status
- `none` - No relationship → Shows "Add Friend"
- `pending_sent` - Request sent by current user → Shows "Request Sent"
- `pending_received` - Request received by current user → Shows "Accept/Reject"
- `friends` - Already friends → Shows "Friends"

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open the file `FRIEND_REQUESTS_MIGRATION.sql`
4. Copy all the SQL code
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 2: Test the Feature
1. Make sure you have at least 2 test users in your system
2. Log in as User A
3. Go to the social feed
4. Find a post from User B
5. Click the "Add Friend" button next to their name
6. Log out and log in as User B
7. Click the notification bell icon in the header
8. You should see the friend request from User A
9. Click "Accept" to become friends
10. The button will change to "Friends" on both sides

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `FRIEND_REQUESTS_MIGRATION.sql` - Database schema
- `src/components/SocialFeed/AddFriendButton.tsx` - Friend button component
- `src/components/SocialFeed/FriendRequestsNotification.tsx` - Notification component
- `FRIEND_REQUEST_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation file

### Modified Files:
- `src/lib/social.ts` - Added friend request functions and interfaces
- `src/components/SocialFeed/PostCard.tsx` - Integrated AddFriendButton
- `src/components/SocialFeed/FeedPage.tsx` - Added notification component

## Features

✅ Send friend requests
✅ Accept/reject requests
✅ Cancel sent requests
✅ Unfriend users
✅ Notification badge with count
✅ Dropdown showing all pending requests
✅ Dynamic button states
✅ Real-time status updates
✅ Optimistic UI updates
✅ Loading states
✅ Error handling
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ Prevents self-friending
✅ Prevents duplicate requests
✅ Row Level Security on all operations

## Security

The implementation includes comprehensive security:
- RLS policies ensure users can only:
  - Send requests as themselves
  - View their own sent/received requests
  - Accept/reject requests sent to them
  - Cancel their own sent requests
- Prevents self-friending at database level
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate requests
- All sensitive operations require authentication

## Styling

All components follow your existing design system:
- Dark theme with gradient backgrounds
- Rounded buttons with hover effects
- Blue for primary actions (Add Friend, Accept)
- Gray for neutral states (Request Sent, Friends)
- Red for destructive actions (Reject, Remove Friend, Cancel)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Shadow effects for depth
- Mobile-friendly touch targets

## Next Steps

After running the database migration, your friend request system is fully functional! Users can now:
- Add friends from any post in the feed
- Receive notifications for pending requests
- Accept or reject friend requests
- Manage their friendships

The feature integrates seamlessly with your existing social feed and maintains the same visual style and user experience.
